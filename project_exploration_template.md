### Transformation 1
**Description:** Split timestamp features to day, month and time

**Soundness Justification:**
The feature dispatch_date records the date of the crime. This can be converted to datetime type to extract the day of month and day of week that the crime happened. Generating the day of the week will be useful as additional information for the model.

### Transformation 2
**Description:** Imputation with KNN

**Soundness Justification:** The latitude and longitude features contain missing values. However these values cannot be empty for any given location because every point on earth has unique coordinates. Hence we will use KNN imputer to identify the most suitable latitude and longitude based on the other geo-location features.

### Transformation 3
**Description:** Normalization

**Soundness Justification:** The numeric features dispatch_day, dispatch_month and dispatch_time have different ranges. Hence we normalize them to fit it in the range [0, 1].


## Visualization
### Visual 1
### Scatter plot of Latitudes and Longitudes
#### File: visuals/latANDlng.png
**Analysis:** There is high correlation between the latitude and longitude of the location where the crime occurred. However, there exist values in both features that contribute to both linear and inverse linear correlation.

### Visual 2
### Scatter plot of Latitudes and dispatch_time_seconds
#### File: visuals/latANDdispatch_time_seconds.png
**Analysis:** The scatterplot does not fit any polynomial function. This shows that the latitude and time of crime have very minimal correlation.

### Visual 3
### Scatter plot of Longitudes and dispatch_time_seconds
#### File: visuals/lngANDdispatch_time_seconds.png
**Analysis:** The scatterplot does not fit any polynomial function. This shows that the longitude and time of crime have very minimal correlation.

### Visual 4
### Histogram of unique words
#### File: visuals/dispatch_month_hist.png
**Analysis:** This is a histogram of the feature dispatch_month. It shows that the highest number of crimes were recorded in the 11th month i.e., November and the lowest number of crimes were recorded in the 3rd month i.e., March.
