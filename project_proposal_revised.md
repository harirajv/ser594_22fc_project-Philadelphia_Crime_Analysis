### Description:
Crime is one of the biggest dangers to a peaceful society and is a serious obstacle to harmonious living. Accurate crime prediction will aid law enforcement authorities in formulating plans to increase public safety. It has been difficult for the scientific community to create precise prediction tools for this purpose since the crime rate depends on several variables. This project seeks to forecast crime rates by utilizing both the location and time of event. This will enable us to identify areas of the city that are vulnerable to specific type of crimes and that have increased criminal activity during specific hours of the day. 

### Research questions:

* RO1: To capture the trends in crime rates across different types of crime

* RO2: To predict the number of crime that happen in a given location

* RO3: To predict the predominant type of crime at a given time of the day

* RO4: To evaluate the causality among the features that lead to increase in trends of crime.

### Intellectual Merit:
The results derived from this project will be useful in identifying locations in Philadeplhia that are vulnerable to specific type of crime. When a combination of such factors occur, we will be able to plan for proactive measures such as increasing police surveillance in vulnerable areas. The results from the model will also provide insight about the measuring the efficiency of each of the police service areas and planning future initiatives that will be effective in preventing crimes such as robbery or shootouts.
